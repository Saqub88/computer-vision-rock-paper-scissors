# Computer Vision RPS

## Milestone 2
Had to create a teachable-macine model using webcam. this would in turn allow the computer to take a visual input of rock, paper or scissors. excited to see how this will play out.
not used the platform before but seemed relatively straight forward. did initially attempt to create a model using 200 images per option using different hand positions to capture a wider variety of positions but this only confused the machine. on 2nd attempt stuck to a rigid hand position for 50 images and this seems to have worked well.
